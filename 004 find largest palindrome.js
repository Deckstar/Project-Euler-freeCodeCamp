Project Euler: Problem 4: Largest palindrome product
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.

/** We need three things:
 * 1) a palindrome checking function, and;
 * 2) a function that returns an arbitrary number of nines (e.g. nines(3) = 999, nines(4) = 9999)
 * 3) a function for running through products and finding the biggest palindrome
