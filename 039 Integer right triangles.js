Project Euler: Problem 39: Integer right triangles
If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ n, is the number of solutions maximised?

/**
 * Inspired by https://www.mathblog.dk/project-euler-39-perimeter-right-angle-triangle/
 *
 * Given the problem, we know that we are dealing with integer sides that sum up to some perimeter P:
 *
 * (1) a^2 + b^2 = c^2
 *
 * (2) a + b + c = P
 *
 * Let's let c = P - a - b and combine the two equations:
 *
 * a^2 + b^2 = (P-a-b)^2
 *
 * which, if written out, gives P^2 + a^2 + b^2 - 2Pa - 2Pb + 2ab.
 * We can continue the simplification to get b in terms of P and a
 *
 * b = (P^2 - 2Pa)/(2P - 2a)
 *
 * So for every combination of P and a, if b is an integer, then we've got a Pythagorean triangle with some given perimeter.
 *
 * What remains is to check every perimeter up to our maximum allowed P, and to see how many integer solutions it has for b.
