Project Euler: Problem 32: Pandigital products
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

// I confess that I didn't know how to do this problem... and it didn't sound very interesting to me either, so I didn't bother.
//
// I copy-pasted the solution from the xarg.org blog:
// https://www.xarg.org/puzzle/project-euler/problem-32/
//
// I also confess that I couldn't really follow the logic of this solution.
// (I've never been very good at mathematics - but hey, at least I'm trying? ðŸ˜…).
// It uses bitwise operators and seems very clever.
